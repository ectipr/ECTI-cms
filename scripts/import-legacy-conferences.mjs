/**
 * Feeds the file scrape-legacy-conferences.mjs produced into Strapi, as
 * activities.
 *
 * Conferences map onto api::activity.activity rather than api::conference —
 * that one is the short "which conferences does ECTI run" summary on the
 * publications page, four rows with no dates. The events page reads activities,
 * which is where a dated list of 41 past conferences belongs.
 *
 * Skips anything already there, matched on slug, so a re-run is safe.
 *
 * Unlike the news import these do NOT arrive as drafts — api::activity.activity
 * has draftAndPublish turned off (see issue #33: it is waiting on a paid Strapi
 * Cloud plan), so there is no unpublished state to hold them in and every one of
 * them is live the moment it is created. Run --dry-run first, and --limit 2 after
 * that; undoing a full run means deleting 41 entries by hand.
 *
 *   STRAPI_URL=... STRAPI_API_TOKEN=... node scripts/import-legacy-conferences.mjs --dry-run
 *   STRAPI_URL=... STRAPI_API_TOKEN=... node scripts/import-legacy-conferences.mjs
 *
 * The token needs write access to activity.
